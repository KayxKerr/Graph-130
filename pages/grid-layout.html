                <h1>Grid Based Layout</h1>
                <p>"Graphic and web-designers work in the dimension that can be broken down to the rectangle, be it a page or a screen. This determines the shape of the grid as well. The lines within the grid are customized. Creators can build the grid themselves or rely on ready grid systems, while designers can use the same grid system throughout the whole piece of design, or create a new grid for each page to express their ideas."<a href="https://www.eleken.co/blog-posts/grid-layout-design-history-tips-and-best-examples" target="_blank"> elenko.co</a></p>

                    <h2>Eros and Sorrow</h2>
                    <p><i>by Patrycja Humienik</i></p>

                    <p>Lance every boat anchored in memory’s
                    harbor. Offshore, someone is moaning<br>
                    in swells that unswell. Cacophony<br>
                    of bells. Bowl of honey pelvis<br>
                    rocked to pleasure, rocked to tears.<br>
                    I’m crying after sex. Kettle’s going off<br>
                    and off—the arrows in that<br>
                    sound could puncture even steel.<br>
                    I pour slowly, opening a curtain<br>
                    in the back of mind.<br>
                    Out the window, the diving swallows<br>
                    thieve my periphery<br>
                    with ceaseless flight;<br>
                    I came from this theft<br>
                    of what cannot be mine. Not time<br>
                    or rivers. Even my devotions<br>
                    refuse possession.<br>

                    <h2>The Fine Air</h2>
                    <p><i>by Rachel Betesh</i></p>

                    <P>tasting of pine, clear<br>
                    breath of it, appetite for feeling spent,<br>
                    shovel-surge<br>
                    light, lighter than<br>
                    it looks, but theseare trees made small.<br>
                    wind of it, delivery,<br>
                    spilled out in pieces: stems, wood-knots,<br>
                    anything that pushed<br>
                    back. heave of it,<br>
                    only the pile was heavy;<br>
                    not the lift, arm by arm.<br>
                    that was easy,<br>
                    the way branches look,<br>
                    how they just keep<br>
                    heading out into it, the fine air<br>
                    of fir-tips where<br>
                    that’s all right.<br>

                    <h2>These feelings are already known</h2>
                    <p><i>by Loisa Fenichell</i></p>

                    <p>I see scattered rivers and think I might belong here<br> 
                    to stay. That I belong<br>
                    to some earth-toned myth, my mouth brimmed<br>
                    by dirt. It’s the longing I have<br>
                    for the dogs gnawing and panting<br>
                    along the side of the highway.<br>
                    Somebody who understands<br>
                    that when I carve my path into the belly<br>
                    of some strange animal, I still<br>
                    do not mean violence. In one palm I hold all<br> 
                    the old haunts and all the old moons.<br>
                    The other hand flips through psalms<br>
                    until I learn over again to weep.<br> 
                    Picture a life stained by omens then tell<br> 
                    me what I mean by a life. There are<br>
                    the formal kinds of stains that develop like a loss.<br> 
                    The stains that grow over a mother’s linen dress.<br>
